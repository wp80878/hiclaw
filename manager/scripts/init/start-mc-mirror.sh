#!/bin/bash
# start-mc-mirror.sh - Initialize MinIO storage and start periodic Remote->Local sync
#
# Manager's own workspace (/root/manager-workspace/) is LOCAL ONLY and not synced to MinIO.
# MinIO only stores shared data and worker configs (/root/hiclaw-fs/).
#
# ── File Sync Design Principle ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
#   Local -> Remote (push):
#     The party that writes a file is responsible for pushing it to MinIO
#     immediately via explicit mc cp/mirror. No background Local->Remote sync.
#
#   Remote -> Local (pull):
#     The party that modifies files in MinIO is responsible for notifying the
#     other side via Matrix @mention, so the receiver can pull on demand.
#     Examples:
#       - Manager pushes task spec → @mentions Worker → Worker runs file-sync
#       - Worker pushes task result → @mentions Manager → Manager runs mc mirror
#       - Manager pushes skill update → push-worker-skills.sh notifies Worker
#
#   This script only provides a 5-minute fallback pull as a safety net, in case
#   an on-demand pull was missed (e.g., agent didn't follow SKILL.md exactly).
#   Normal operation should NOT rely on this fallback.
